## Run
The HTTP server by default runs on port 9000. So to run the server:
> `sbt run`

It should start the server at `localhost:9000`.

Now you may use a Web Browser to open URL - `localhost:9000`, it should open a web page, click on `login` button
and enter credentials.
E.g.
username - `scala_user`
password - `p`

Password `p` is a valid password according to the dump application ;)
